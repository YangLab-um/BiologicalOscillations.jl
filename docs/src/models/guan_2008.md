The article [A robust and tunable mitotic oscillator in artificial cells](https://elifesciences.org/articles/33549) describes the development of an artificial cell that sustains cell cycle signaling oscillations. In their work, the authors develop a mathematical model to describe the activity of two key proteins driving these oscillations: Cyclin B1 and Cdk1. Using a two-ODE model, the authors can capture the essential behavior of their artificial cell setup. Here, we base model used in their study under through the `ReactionNetwork` called `guan_2008`. The equations governing the evolution of the system are:

```@example guan_2008
odesys = convert(ODESystem, guan_2008) # hide
eq = latexify(odesys) # hide
LaTeXEquation(eq) # hide
```

Using the parameters specified in the manuscript (with `r=1.5`) we obtain the following solution:

```@example guan_2008
plot(sol) # hide
```
